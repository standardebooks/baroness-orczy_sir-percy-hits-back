			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XVII</h2>
			<p>The Hôtel de Ville at Orange still stands, as it did then, in the newly-named Place de la République; and if the tourist of today mounts its steps, enters the building through its central portal, crosses the wide vestibule and finally turns down a long corridor on his right, he will, almost at the end of this, come to a door which bears the legend: “<i xml:lang="fr">Travaux Publics.</i>”</p>
			<p>Should he be bold enough to push open the door, he will find himself in a perfectly banal room, with whitewashed walls covered with maps and plans that are of no interest to him, a large desk at one end, and a few wooden chairs. There is a thin carpet in the middle of the red-tiled floor and faded green rep curtains temper the glaring light of the afternoon sun. But on this day of May 1794 there were no curtains to the window, and not even a strip of carpet on the floor. There was no desk either, only a long trestle table covered with a tattered green cloth, behind which, on wooden chairs, sat three men, dressed alike in dark blue coats tightly buttoned across the chest, drab breeches and high topped boots, and wearing tricolour sashes around their waist.</p>
			<p>The one who sat in the centre and who appeared to be in supreme authority rested his elbow on the table, and his chin was supported in his hand. He was gazing intently on a man who stood before him, in the centre of the room, the other side of the table; a man who looked footsore and weary and who wore a military uniform all tattered and covered with slime and dust.</p>
			<p>The two others also kept their eyes fixed on this man. They were listening with rapt interest to the story which he was relating. Early this morning he and a dozen others also attired in tattered uniforms had come into Orange in a state bordering on collapse. They had made their way to the barracks where the officer in command had mercifully given them food and drink. As soon as they had eaten and drunk, they tried to tell their story; but this was so amazing, not to say incredible, that the officer in command had thought it prudent to send for the superintendent of gendarmerie, who in turn had the men conveyed to the Hôtel de Ville, there to be brought before the Representative of the Convention on special mission who sat with the Committee of Public Safety. And now Lieutenant Godet stood alone to face the Committee; the others had been handed back to the gendarmerie to be dealt with later on. The representative on special mission who sat with the two other Members of the Committee at the table covered with the tattered green cloth, had questioned Godet, and he thereupon embarked upon the story of this amazing adventure. He began by relating the events which three days ago had set the quiet little commune of Laragne seething with excitement. He told of the arrival of the squad of soldiers in magnificent uniforms, under the command of an officer more superb than anything that had ever been seen in the countryside before. He told of the perquisition in the house of Citizen Colombe the grocer, by those magnificent soldiers, of the finding there by them of certain valuables belonging to the ci-devant Frontenacs, valuables which he himself had vainly searched for in the château, the evening before. He told of the arrest of young Colombe: of the high-handed manner in which the superb officer had relieved him, Godet, of his command, and ordered him and his men, together with the ci-devant Frontenac, to join his squad, and to march with him out of Laragne. He had told it all with a wealth of detail, and the members of the Committee had listened in silence and with rapt interest.</p>
			<p>But now the man at the table who was the representative on special mission, and who appeared chief in authority, broke in with an exclamation that was almost one of rage.</p>
			<p>“And do you mean to tell me, citizen lieutenant,” he said in a harsh, rasping voice, “that you could mistake a lot of English spies⁠—for that is what they were, you may take it from me⁠—that you could mistake them, I say, for soldiers of our army. Where were your eyes?”</p>
			<p>Lieutenant Godet gave a shrug which he hoped would pass for unconcern. In reality he felt physically sick; a prey to overwhelming terror. At first, when he and his men had come in sight of the city, they had felt nothing but relief to see the end of what had been almost martyrdom. It was only afterwards, when he found himself in this narrow room, with its whitewashed walls and its silence, and face to face with those three men, that fear had entered his heart. He felt like an animal in a cage⁠—a mouse looking into the pale, piercing eyes of a cat. He passed his tongue once or twice over his parched lips before he gave reply.</p>
			<p>“I was not the only one, citizen,” he said sullenly, “who was deceived. The whole commune of Laragne was at the heels of those soldiers. My own men were mustered before the pseudo-captain and heard him give words of command.”</p>
			<p>“But Englishmen, citizen lieutenant,” the man at the table argued; “Englishmen! Their appearance! Their speech!”</p>
			<p>“They spoke as you and I would, Citizen Chauvelin,” Godet retorted, still sullenly, “As for appearance, one man is like another. I could not be expected to know every officer of our army by sight.”</p>
			<p>“But you said they were splendidly dressed!”</p>
			<p>“They were. I knew the uniform well enough. Had there been a doubtful button or a galloon wanting I should have spotted it.</p>
			<p>“But so clean!” one of the others at the table remarked with a sigh, that might have been of envy, “so magnificent!”</p>
			<p>“I knew that there were some <i xml:lang="fr">compagnies d’élite</i>,” the lieutenant rejoined, “attached to certain regiments. How could I guess?”</p>
			<p>“It might have been better for you, if you had,” the man in the centre remarked dryly.</p>
			<p>Godet’s wan face took on a more ashen hue; again he passed his tongue over his parched lips.</p>
			<p>“Haven’t we had enough of this?” one of the others at the table now put in impatiently. “We are satisfied that those English spies, or whatever they were, acted with amazing effrontery, which makes me think that perhaps they are a part of that gang that we all know of, and of which Citizen Chauvelin spoke just now. We are also satisfied that Citizen Lieutenant Godet did not show that acumen which an officer in his responsible position should have done. What we want to know now is, what happened after the pseudo-captain of the so-called 33rd division had arrested that young Colombe and marched out of Laragne?”</p>
			<p>“And in your interest, citizen lieutenant,” the man in the centre rejoined sternly, “I advise you to make a statement that is truthful in every detail.”</p>
			<p>“Had I wished to tell lies,” the soldier retorted sullenly, “I shouldn’t be here now. I should have⁠—”</p>
			<p>“No matter,” the other broke in curtly, “what you would have done. The State desires to know what you did.”</p>
			<p>“Well!” Lieutenant Godet began after a moment or two during which he appeared to collect his thoughts. “We marched out of Laragne in the direction of Serres. The captain⁠—I still, of course, looked upon him as a captain⁠—had so disposed us that I and my own men were between two squads of his. We were footsore, all of us, because we had had three days’ tramping in the dust, one day battling against hard wind, another with long hours spent in scouring the château of those traitors Frontenacs; we were also very hungry. Remember that we had been dragged out of our beds in the early morning, and not given a chance of getting a bite or drink before starting on the march. But they, the others, were fresh as if they had just come out of barracks with their bellies full.⁠ ⁠… They marched along at a swinging pace, and it was as much as we could do to keep step with them.”</p>
			<p>The man’s voice became somewhat more steady as he talked. The note of terror which had been so conspicuous in it at first had given place to one of dull resentment. Encouraged by the obvious interest which his story had evoked in his hearers, he resumed more glibly:</p>
			<p>“About half a league north of Laragne, a bridle-path branches off the high road; into this the captain ordered his company to turn, and we continued to plod along through the dust and in the midday heat, till we came to a tumble-down cottage by the roadside; a cottage flanked by a dilapidated shed, and a bit of garden all overgrown with weeds. Here a halt was called, and the prisoners were ordered out of the wagon. A moment or two later a woman appeared at the cottage door, some words were exchanged between her and the captain, and subsequently, when order to march was given, the prisoners marched along with us; the wagon and horses having been left behind at the cottage.”</p>
			<p>“Didn’t you think this very strange, citizen lieutenant?” one of the men at the table asked; “a wagon and horses which you would naturally presume belonged to the State, being thus left at a tumble-down roadside cottage?”</p>
			<p>“Whatever I may have thought,” the lieutenant replied, “it was not my place to make observations to my superior officer.”</p>
			<p>“Superior officer!” the man in the centre remarked, with a gesture of contemptuous wrath.</p>
			<p>“I think, Citizen Chauvelin,” the accused now put in a little more firmly, “that you are unnecessarily hard on me. There was really nothing to indicate⁠—”</p>
			<p>But the other broke in with a vicious snarl:</p>
			<p>“Nothing to indicate⁠—? Nothing? The eyes of a patriot should be sharp enough to detect a spy or a traitor through any disguise⁠—”</p>
			<p>He paused abruptly, and cast a quick, inquisitorial glance at his two colleagues first, then at the soldier before him. Had he detected a trace, a sign, a flicker of the eyelid that betrayed knowledge of his own past? of the times⁠—numberless now⁠—that he too had been hoodwinked by those bold adventurers who called themselves the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and by their chief whose prowess in the art of disguise had marked some of the most humiliating hours in Chauvelin’s career? Calais, Boulogne, Nantes, Paris; each of those great cities had a record of the Terrorist’s discomfiture when brought face to face with that mysterious and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel. Even, now crushed in the hot palm of his hand, he held a scrap of paper which had revealed the author of the plot to which that fool Lieutenant Godet had fallen a victim⁠—just as he, himself, Chauvelin, had done⁠—just like that⁠—and so many times⁠—. The penalty for him had always been more humiliation, a further fall from the original high place which he had once occupied in Paris: and with it the knowledge that one day the masters of France would tire of his failures. Ah! he knew that well enough, he knew that they would tire, and then they would crush him as they had crushed others, whose only crime, like his, had been failure.</p>
			<p>His only claim to immunity, so far, had been the fact that he alone, of all the members of the National Assembly, of all the members of Committees, or of the Executive, knew who the Scarlet Pimpernel really was; he had seen him without disguise; he knew him by name, not only him but some of his more important followers; and when some of the ferocious tyrants, who for the time being were the masters of France, did at times loudly demand the suppression of Citizen Chauvelin, for incompetence that amounted to treason, there were always others who pleaded for him because of that knowledge. Many felt that with the death of Chauvelin, the last hope of capturing that band of English spies would have to be abandoned; and so they pleaded for his retention and their fellow-tyrants allowed him another few months’ grace so that he might accomplish that which they knew was the great purpose of his life. And whenever in the opinion of those bloodthirsty tigers, who held France under their domination, some outlying provincial districts had need of what they called “purging from the pestilence of traitors,” whenever wholesale arrests, perquisitions, wholesale death-sentences or brutal massacres were the order of the day, Citizen Chauvelin was sent down with special powers, always in the vain hope that the Scarlet Pimpernel, emboldened by success, would fall into the trap perpetually set for him. The English spy’s predilection for aristos, his sympathies so quickly aroused when traitors happened to be women or young children, was sure to draw his activities to any region where prisons were full and the guillotine kept busy.</p>
			<p>Thus it was that Citizen Chauvelin had been sent to Orange. The Southern provinces of France had been left far too long to welter in a morass of treason; there were veritable nests of traitors in the châteaux and farms of Provence and Dauphiné. The country had to be purged: the traitors extirpated; the magnificent Law of the Suspect be set in motion to do this cleansing process. Any man who ventured to criticize the government, who complained of taxation or restrictions was a traitor; any man or woman who owned more than they needed for bare subsistence, who refused to pour of their surplus into the lap of patriots, was a traitor; and the country must be purged of them, until the dictatorship of the proletariat was firmly established, until every man, woman and child in the whole of France had been dragged down to the same level of mental and physical wreckage.</p>
			<p>There had been a dramatic pause after Chauvelin’s outburst of contemptuous wrath; for a minute or two, while the old clock up on the wall ticked away with slow monotony a strange silence remained hanging over the scene. Whatever the other three men may have known or remembered of the noted Terrorist’s past history, they thought it wiser to say nothing. In these days of universal brotherhood and Liberty, every man in France was frightened of his neighbour. The time had come when the lustful tigers, satiated with the blood of those whom they deemed their enemies, had turned, thirsting, for that of their whilom friends. The makers of the Terror had started digging their fangs into each other’s throats. The victory now was to the most ferocious. After the Girondins, Danton, he, who had ordered the September massacres, two and a half years ago, had had to yield to a more vengeful, more merciless power than his own.</p>
			<p>Chauvelin knew that. The victory today was to the most ferocious. He who would sacrifice friends, brother, sister, child, was the true patriot; the man who stayed his hand in face of a revolting crime that would put a wild beast to the blush, was unworthy the name of citizen of France. Therefore death to him. Death to the weakling. To the Moderate. This was the era of the Universal Brotherhood of Death.</p>
			<p>What chance then had this unfortunate Lieutenant Godet now? brought to justice⁠—save the mark!⁠—before a man who knew that to show weakness was to court death. No wonder that all the swagger and the arrogance which made him but a day or two ago the terror of a lot of peasants at Sisteron or Laragne, was knocked out of him, by a mere glance from those pale, piercing eyes. And he⁠—a mere notary’s clerk born and bred in the depth of Dauphiné, and thrust into the army, as a mule is thrust into harness⁠—knew nothing of Paris save from hearsay, and nothing of the men whose word had even sent a king and a queen to the scaffold. He knew nothing of Citizen Chauvelin, save that he was a man of power, before whose piercing glance and tricolour sash, every man instinctively cringed and trembled. He knew nothing of Chauvelin’s tussles with those same English spies who had so effectually led him, Godet, by the nose; nothing of Citizen Chauvelin’s past life, very little of the present. He was just a mouse in the power of a cat; allowed a little freedom just now, while he told his tale of failure.</p>
			<p>“Continue, citizen lieutenant,” Chauvelin now said more calmly. “We are listening.”</p>
			<p>“Let me see,” Godet rejoined vaguely, “where was I?”</p>
			<p>“On the bridle-path off the main road,” Chauvelin responded with a sneer; “half a league north of Laragne. The wagon and horses presumably belonging to the State left in a tumble-down cottage by the roadside. A thrilling situation forsooth. An ordinary situation you would have us believe. Pray continue. What happened after that?”</p>
			<p>“We marched and we marched and we marched,” the lieutenant resumed sullenly. “We marched until we were ready to drop. We had had three days of marching, and had started in the morning without a bite, hungry! <i xml:lang="fr">Nom d’un nom!</i> how hungry we were! and weak and faint! The hours sped on; we could see the sun mounting the heavens and then start on its descent. The heat was intense, the dust terrible. It filled our eyes, our nostrils, our mouths. The soles of our feet were bleeding, sweat poured down our faces and obscured our vision. We marched and we marched, through two villages, the names of which I do not know; then over mountain passes, across rocky gorges, stepping over streams, climbing the sides of hills, the banks of rivers. I am a stranger in these parts. And I was tired. Tired! I knew not where we were, whither we were going. March! March! March! Ceaselessly. Even had I dared, I would no longer have had the strength to ask questions or to beg for mercy.”</p>
			<p>And at the recollection of those hours of agony, Lieutenant Godet wiped the perspiration from his streaming brow.</p>
			<p>“Well?” Chauvelin queried dryly, “and the others, the Englishmen?”</p>
			<p>“They marched along at a swinging pace,” Godet replied, smothering a savage oath. “Without turning a hair. They kicked up no dust. They did not sweat. They just marched. No doubt their bellies were well filled.”</p>
			<p>“And the prisoners?”</p>
			<p>“They set to with a will. And I make no doubt but they had fed and drunk while they sat in the wagon. At any rate they showed no fatigue.”</p>
			<p>“How long did you continue on the march?”</p>
			<p>“Till one by one we⁠—my comrades and I⁠—fell out by the roadside.”</p>
			<p>“And those who fell out were left, while the others went on?”</p>
			<p>“Yes! We had gone through the second village, and were marching along the edge of a stream, when the first lot of us dropped out. Three of my men. They just rolled down the bank of the stream; and there lay on their stomachs trying to drink. The captain⁠—or whatever he was, curse him!⁠—called ‘Halt!’ and one of his men ran down the bank and had a look at those three poor fellows who lay there striving to slake their hunger as well as their thirst in the cool mountain stream. But, <i xml:lang="fr">nom de nom</i>! They⁠—the miscreants!⁠—had no bowels of compassion. I believe⁠—for in truth I was too tired to see anything clearly⁠—that one of them did leave a hunk of bread by the side of the stream: perhaps he was afraid that those poor fellows would die of inanition and then their death would be upon his conscience.”</p>
			<p>“Well! And did all the men fall out that way?”</p>
			<p>“Yes! We were marching three abreast: and three by three we all fell out. Always beside the stream, for we suffered from thirst as much as from hunger. The stream seemed to draw us, and three of us, as if by common understanding, would just roll down the bank and lie on our stomachs and try to drink. The captain no longer called a halt when that happened. One of his own men would just throw pieces of bread down to the edge of the stream, just as they would to a dog.”</p>
			<p>“And you were the last to fall out?”</p>
			<p>“The very last. I verily believe, when I rolled down the bank and felt the cool stream against my face, that I had died and reached the Elysian fields. A piece of bread was thrown to me, and I fell on it like a starved beast.”</p>
			<p>“And then what happened?”</p>
			<p>“Nothing.”</p>
			<p>“What do you mean? Nothing?”</p>
			<p>“Nothing as far as we were concerned. The bank of the stream, for a length of two kilometres or more, was strewn with our dead⁠—that is not dead, you understand, but fatigued, and only half-conscious with hunger: while those miscreants, those limbs of Satan, marched off without as much as a last look at us! Gaily they marched away singing. Yes, singing, some awful gibberish, in a tongue I did not understand. That is,” poor Godet went on ruefully, “when first I had an inkling of the awful truth. That strange tongue gave it away. You understand?”</p>
			<p>The others nodded.</p>
			<p>“And then, by chance, I put my hand in the back pocket of my tunic, and felt that piece of paper.”</p>
			<p>With finger that quivered slightly, he pointed to Chauvelin’s hand; between the clenched claw-like fingers there protruded the corner of a scrap of paper. Chauvelin failed to suppress the exclamation of rage which rose to his lips.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Nom de nom!</i>” he muttered savagely through his teeth, and with his handkerchief he wiped the beads of moisture that had risen to the roots of his hair.</p>
			<p>“And so they marched away,” one of the others remarked dryly. “In which direction?”</p>
			<p>“Straight on,” the soldier replied laconically.</p>
			<p>“On the way to Nyons, I suppose, and Walreas?”</p>
			<p>“I suppose so. I don’t know the neighbourhood.”</p>
			<p>“You do not seem to have known much, Lieutenant Godet,” Chauvelin put in with a sneer.</p>
			<p>“I come from the other side of the Drac,” Godet retorted. “I could not⁠—”</p>
			<p>But Chauvelin broke in with an oath:</p>
			<p>“Wherever you come from, citizen,” he said sternly, “it was your duty to become acquainted with the country through which you were ordered to march your men.”</p>
			<p>“I had no orders to take them through mountain passes,” Godet remarked sullenly. “We came through here a month ago and have kept to the high road. At Sisteron I had my orders to arrest the ci-devant Frontenacs. You, Citizen Chauvelin, must know how conscientiously I did my duty. All the orders you gave me I fulfilled. After Sisteron you ordered me to go to Laragne, and thence to Serres. It was you ordered me to halt at Laragne for the night.”</p>
			<p>“All this is beside the point,” one of the others broke in roughly. “All we can gather from this confused tale is that all traces of the English spies have completely vanished.”</p>
			<p>“For the moment,” Chauvelin assented dryly. “It is for Lieutenant Godet to find those traces again.”</p>
			<p>He spoke now with extreme bitterness, and the glances which he levelled at Godet were both hostile and threatening. It would be curious to try and follow the mental processes which had given rise to this hostility. Godet, after all said and done, had only failed in the same manner as he himself, Chauvelin, had so often done. He had been hoodwinked by a particularly astute and daring adventurer who was an avowed enemy of France: and if being thus hoodwinked was a crime against the State, then the powerful member of the Committee of Public Safety and the humble lieutenant of infantry were fellow-criminals. This, of course, Godet did not know. Not yet: or he would not have been in such dread of this man with the pale eyes and the talon-like hands. The others he did not fear nearly so much. No doubt they too were cruel and vengeful these days. Strike or the blow will fall on you, was the rule of every man’s conduct. Pochart and Danou took their cue from Chauvelin; his was the mastermind, his the more ruthless nature, all they did was to try and show their zeal by saying Amen to every suggestion, every sarcasm, every accusation put forth by their colleague.</p>
			<p>In fact the proceedings by now had developed into a kind of duel between the accused and the principal judge; it was a duel made up of acrimonious accusations on the one hand, and of defence that weakened perceptibly as the accused became more and more confused through ever increasing terror. The other two only put in a word here and there. They wished to know how the adventure had finally come to an end.</p>
			<p>“In a long, weary tramp to Orange,” Godet replied; “weary beyond what words can describe, footsore, hungry and thirsty we tramped.”</p>
			<p>They had to cover three leagues. How they lived through it, they none of them knew. At one or two villages which they encountered, they obtained a little food, and some drink. For the space of a league and a half, he, Godet, and two others got a lift in a farmer’s wagon. On the way they asked news of the English spies. They had been seen marching merrily; but soon all traces of them had vanished.</p>
			<p>“Had I been the traitor you say I am, Citizen Chauvelin,” Godet said in the end, “would I have come into Orange with my tale? I would have tried to run away and to hide. Made my way to Toulons, what? and joined the army there. You would not have found me then; months would have gone by before you heard of my adventure.”</p>
			<p>“You underestimate the power which is in my hands, citizen lieutenant,” was Chauvelin’s curt comment. “Only one thing could save you from the consequences of your treachery, and that was to speak the truth and to redeem your crime.”</p>
			<p>He paused a moment, and then addressing his two colleagues he said with slow deliberation:</p>
			<p>“We all agree, I think, that Citizen Lieutenant Godet has been guilty of gross negligence, which today, when France is threatened by traitors within as well as by her enemies on her frontier, amounts to treason against the State. Silence!” he went on, throwing a stern glance on Godet who had uttered a violent word of protest. “Listen to what hope of indulgence it is in my power to give you. The State against whom you have sinned will grant you the chance of retrieving your crime. We will grant you full powers under the new Law of the Suspect. You shall go into the highways and the byways with full power to seize any man, woman or child, whom you as much as vaguely suspect of complicity in this affair. Do you understand?”</p>
			<p>“I think I do,” Godet replied dully.</p>
			<p>“The State,” Pochart put in sagely, “would rather have the English spies’ than your head, citizen lieutenant.”</p>
			<p>“The State will have Citizen Godet’s head,” Chauvelin rejoined dryly, “or the English spies. The choice rests with Citizen Godet himself.”</p>
			<p>There was a moment’s pause. The eyes of the soldier were fixed upon the pale, determined face of his ruthless judge. He knew that his life hung upon the decision uttered by those thin, bloodless lips. He was in the grip of a white terror; his teeth were clenched and his tongue clove, hard and dry, against the roof of his mouth. He was terrified, and in his wildly beating heart there was an immense hatred for the man who thus terrorized him. He longed to get at him, to grip him by the throat, to scream out insults into that pale, stern, colourless face. He longed to see that same fear of death which was paralysing him, dim the light of those pale eyes. His own impotence made that hatred more intense. It shone out of his eyes, and Chauvelin meeting them caught the glance like that of an enraged cur, ready to spring. Indifferent, he shrugged his shoulders and the ghost of a sneer curled round his thin lips. He was accustomed to hatred and desire for revenge.</p>
			<p>“Citizen lieutenant,” he said at last, “you have heard the decision of the committee. It has been found expedient to withhold punishment from you, because it is in your power to serve the State in a way that no other man could do at this moment. You have seen the English spies face to face; you know something of their appearance, something of their mode of speech. Go then into the highways and byways, the men who with you were guilty of negligence shall go with you. It is for you to use the full powers which the Law of the Suspect has placed in your hands. Go scour the country. Yours is the power to seize any man, woman or child whom you suspect of treason to the State, make use of that power in order to track down to their lair the English foxes who have outwitted you. Only let me add a word of warning in your ear. Do not be led by the nose a second time. If you are, no power on earth will save you. The State may forgive incompetence once: the second time it will bear the ugly name of treason.”</p>
			<p>He had risen to his feet, and just for a moment the muscles of his hand relaxed, and the scrap of paper which he had crushed into a ball rolled upon the table.</p>
			<p>His colleague Pochart picked it up and idly opened and smoothed it out: he studied for a moment or two the close writing upon it, then looked inquiringly up at Chauvelin.</p>
			<p>“Can you tell us what is written on this paper, citizen?” he asked.</p>
			<p>And while he spoke he tossed the paper across to his colleague Danou.</p>
			<p>“Is it English?” Danou asked puzzled.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” Chauvelin replied curtly.</p>
			<p>“It looks like poetry,” Pochart remarked.</p>
			<p>“Doggerel verses,” commented Chauvelin.</p>
			<p>“And you can’t read it?”</p>
			<p>“No!”</p>
			<p>“I thought you knew English.”</p>
			<p>“Not I.”</p>
			<p>“Strange why a bit of doggerel verse should have been slipped into the pocket of Citizen Godet’s tunic,” Pochart remarked dryly. “And there’s your name, Citizen Chauvelin,” he added, pointing to the words “A <i xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i> Chauvelin,” which preceded the four lines of poetry written in English, a language which, apparently, no one here understood.</p>
			<p>But Chauvelin was at the end of his patience. He seized the scrap of paper and tore it savagely into innumerable little pieces.</p>
			<p>“Enough of this futility,” he said, and brought his clenched fist down with a crash on the table. “The English spies have been facetious, that is all. We do them too much honour by attaching importance to this senseless, childish verse. Lieutenant Godet,” he went on, once more addressing the accused, “you are dismissed, under the conditions I told you of just now. When next we meet face to face, you will either be the lucky man who has helped to lay these impudent English adventurers by the heel, or you will stand before me arraigned for treason and preparing for death. Now you can go.”</p>
			<p>Without another word Godet turned on his heel and went out of the room. Past the guard at the door, he went with head erect, and with a firm step he walked the whole length of the corridor. But there was one moment when in the vestibule he found himself alone. Unwatched. At any rate he thought so. So he paused and looked over his shoulder in the direction of the room where he had just spent an uncomfortable two hours. He paused and raising his fist, he shook it at the unseen presence of the man who had so terrorized him, and whom he hated because of the terror which he inspired.</p>
			<p>“With a bit of luck,” he muttered through his teeth, “we shall be even yet, you and I, <i xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i> Chauvelin.”</p>
			<p>Then once more with a firm step he walked out of the Town Hall.</p>
