			<p>Perquisitions in these days of Liberty, Fraternity and Equality were perhaps among the minor horrors that befell innocent and guilty alike, at the behest of tyrants more implacable than the Inquisitors of Medieval Spain, more cruel than the Borgias: but they were terrible nevertheless. A perquisition meant, in most cases, the destruction of every household treasure, every family relic cherished through generations, it meant the wanton smashing of furniture and mirrors, the ripping up of valuable tapestries and of mattresses, the defacement of priceless pictures, it meant prying, hostile eyes thrust into receptacles, however secret, into private papers and even letters. Nothing was sacred to men deputed to insult and to offend, just as much as to search.</p>
			<p>When Fleurette reached that part of the house which was occupied by the family, she was confronted by the wildest, the most heart-stirring confusion. The carpets had been torn off the floors, the furniture for the most part lay in broken heaps about the rooms, mirrors and pictures had been dragged off the walls, broken crockery and glass was scattered everywhere, intermingled with horsehair and other stuffing out of chairs and mattresses, whilst all the walls, the doors, the window-frames bore traces of rude handling with bayonet or the heel of a boot. Fleurette, wide-eyed and appalled, ran from room to room; the guttering tallow-candle which she held threw flickering lights and grotesque shadows on the scattered objects about her, made them seem more weird, like the appurtenances of an abode of ghosts. Here in the pretty boudoir Mademoiselle’s embroidery frame lay smashed to tinder wood with threads of the work still hanging to it, bits of rags, pathetic in their look of abandonment and desolation. There in the withdrawing room, the beautiful satinwood spinet with its painted panels and exquisite marqueterie was lying on its side, its body gaping like a gigantic wound, the strings emitting a final vibration like the last song of a dying swan.</p>
			<p>From the direction of the dining-room came the incessant murmur of voices, but throughout the rest of the apartments, in the midst of all the wreckage, a silence reigned as of the grave. The place now was completely deserted. It seemed almost as if some terrible tornado had swept through these living-rooms: some implacable forces of nature rather than the hatred and cupidity of men. An earthquake could not have been more devastating, a fire more destructive.</p>
			<p>And now in the midst of it all Fleurette came to a standstill, candle in hand: her breath came and went in quick short gasps, and her heart was beating furiously. The silence in this semidarkness with those long, ghostlike shadows seemed to oppress her; the broken bits of beautiful things which she had known and loved ever since she remembered anything, gave her an awful feeling of desolation and a kind of foreboding of things, still worse, to come. It was instinct which had brought her to a halt here in this one room amongst the others. It was always known as Madame’s room, for here Madame would always sit when she gave her orders to various members of the household, here that she would look through the household accounts whilst Fleurette and Rose, when they were still children, would sit in a corner of the sofa by the huge hearth, hand in hand, with a picture book on their knees, silent like a pair of tiny white mice, waiting until Madame had finished her accounts, because then they would all go into the garden to gather flowers for the rooms, and fruit for dessert, or perhaps go down into the kitchen and learn how to dress a chicken for the table, or how best to mix a salad.</p>
			<p>And Fleurette stood for a moment or two quite still, holding the candle high above her head, contemplating this wreckage. Then, having found a safe place on which to deposit the candle, she carefully closed the door which gave, like several others, on a long corridor that led to the main staircase at one end and to the service stairs at the other. The time had come to cease contemplation, to drive away superstitious fears and to act. Closing her eyes, Fleurette strove first of all to recapture pictures of long ago, to recreate the scenes enacted in this room, before this awful calamity had fallen on these people whom she loved so dearly. Memory was not rebellious. She could see the whole picture just as it had impressed itself on the tablets of her mind when she used to sit here as a child. There by the window Madame’s desk used to stand. It was lying on its side now, the drawers wrenched open, the handles broken, papers, pen and sand scattered about; the ink had run out of the glass container and stained the beautiful old Aubusson carpet. But there Madame used to sit. Fleurette could almost see her now, at the desk. Her big household books open before her. Writing, calculating, and putting her money by in a leather bag. And presently she would rise, pick up her bag and books and carry them across the room to a spot close to the wall, the other side of the hearth. Here she would come to a standstill, and putting her beautiful hand somewhere against the wall, she would turn to the two girls⁠—they were mere children then⁠—and smile at them in a mysterious way; and they would say solemnly: “Open Sesame!” just as they had heard in the tale of Ali Baba and the forty robbers, which Monsieur de Frontenac had often told them. As soon as they had said the magic words the wall would open like the entrance of the robber’s cave in the tale of Ali Baba, disclosing a recess into which Madame would put her books and her bag of money. Then she would once more turn and give a sign to the children and they would say: “Close Sesame!” and the mysterious door would swing to again and no trace be left of the recess which lay hidden somewhere behind the panelled wall.</p>
			<p>The whole of this picture stood out before Fleurette’s mental vision in every detail; the exact spot where Madame used to stand, the way she put out her hand and touched the panelled wall. Carefully picking her way through the maze of broken furniture, Fleurette came to a halt on the very spot where she had so often seen Madame standing, with her books and moneybag in her arms. She put out her hand and touched the panel as Madame had done: all over the carved panel she put her hand, touching and pressing each bit of carving in its turn. Her heart was still beating wildly, but not in any way with fear. In fact she was surprised at herself for not being afraid. It was just the excitement of this wonderful adventure! She, Fleurette, who had seen nothing of the world beyond her own village of Laragne and an occasional glimpse at Sisteron, suddenly found herself guiding the destinies of people whom she loved⁠—the messenger sent by the <i xml:lang="fr">bon Dieu</i> to help them in their need. There is no young human creature living who would not respond, heart and soul, to such a call, and Fleurette was of the South, a child of that romantic land of Dauphiné which had given so many of her heroic sons to strive and work for France.</p>
			<p>And suddenly, as Fleurette pressed her finger on every piece of carved relief, one by one, she felt the centre of a dog-rose yield to the pressure. Softly, noiselessly, the panel swung outwards, and there in the recess were the familiar household books and the moneybag. Beside them lay a leather wallet and a small casket fitted with a brass lock. Without any hesitation Fleurette took the bag, the wallet and the casket, leaving the books where they were. Never for a moment did the thought occur to her that she might be discovered in what would be a highly compromising position. She was too simple-minded, too innately honest to think that she might be suspected of theft.</p>
			<p>Having stowed the wallet and the bag in the wide pockets of her kirtle and hidden the casket beneath her shawl, Fleurette picked her way back across the room. She left the mysterious recess open because she did not know how to close it, and did not want to waste any time in trying to find out. She found her way to the door and opened it, then she blew out the candle and finally peeped out into the corridor.</p>
			<p>It was deserted. The lingering evening light, pale and ghostlike, came creeping in through the row of tall arched windows facing her. As everywhere else in the château, the corridor bore the melancholy traces of the soldiers’ passage. It was the same devastation. The same wanton destruction was only too apparent in the torn carpet and the fragments of glass and broken sconces that littered the floor. Fleurette, turning her back on the direction of the main staircase, made her way to the back stairs which wound in a close spiral down to the service door.</p>
			<p>Fleurette descended with quick, furtive steps, until, past the first curve of the spiral, the stairs were in total darkness. But she would have found her way all about the château blindfold, so well did she know its every nook and cranny. She came to the door and fumbled for the bolts. She had drawn one and taken off the chain, when she heard a measured tramp on the other side of the door. Steps were coming this way along the flagged path; a moment or two later they came to a halt close to the door. Fleurette hardly daring to breathe, listened. A voice said: “Did you go in there?”</p>
			<p>“No, citizen,” replied another, “not by this door. The bolts are fastened on the inside.”</p>
			<p>Something else was said which Fleurette did not catch, and the steps receded in the direction of the front of the house. She waited a minute or two longer, breathless and motionless, until she heard what she thought was the tramp of feet in the corridor above her. The soldiers had apparently been ordered to come round again, perhaps they would be coming down those stairs. To hesitate now might prove fatal. Fumbling once more in the gloom, Fleurette found the last bolt and drew it, and the next moment was out in the open. The back door gave on the yard. On the right were the stables, and facing the door, the riding-school and one or two sheds; on the left the kitchens and servants’ quarters. In this direction too was the great archway and the main entrance into the house. Past the archway was the park and the avenue leading to the big gates.</p>
			<p>After a moment’s reflection Fleurette decided to avoid these main approaches: there was another way across the park, past the stable gate. Hugging the casket closely under her shawl, Fleurette set out in the direction of the stables. There was no one about and she felt comparatively safe. Night was now rapidly drawing in, and she fortunately had on a dark kirtle and dark worsted stockings. The air was very still and the waning moon not yet risen in the east. From far away came the sound of the bell of Laragne church. It struck eight. Fleurette felt a pang of anxiety. She had promised to be home before dark and Louise would be anxious and cross: and there was still something she wanted to do before she went home. Now she was past the stable door where, in a heap, just as old André had said, there lay a pile of faggots. The sight of them gave Fleurette a happy thrill. Was she not obeying the dictates of the mysterious voice which had spoken to her through the medium of the old faggot-carrier?</p>
			<p>The next moment, a firm step resounded on the flagstones of the stables, and a second later a man appeared under the lintel of the door.</p>
			<p>“Fleurette! what in God’s name are you doing here?”</p>
			<p>Smothering a startled cry, Fleurette turned and found herself face to face with her father. He was standing at the stable door; his hands were clasped behind his back, and he had a tricolour sash round his waist. Now women, young girls, especially, those born and bred in outlying country districts, are credited with being stupid, silly in their fears, timorous like hens; and so no doubt would Fleurette have been in ordinary circumstances. She may not have been either clever or brave originally; she would perhaps have behaved in a silly, timorous fashion but for this one fact, that she knew that something terrible was happening to the Frontenacs whom she loved, and that she had been deputed by the <i xml:lang="fr">bon Dieu</i>, or merely by a human friend, to do something important for them. In order to do this she must keep her head; and trust any woman to keep her head if one she loves is in peril.</p>
			<p>“What are you doing here, Fleurette?” Bibi reiterated rather sternly.</p>
			<p>And Fleurette with a well-simulated nervous little laugh retorted lightly:</p>
			<p>“Why, Bibi <i xml:lang="fr">chéri</i>, I might retaliate. What are you doing here? I thought you were on your way to Paris.”</p>
			<p>“What are you doing here, Fleurette?” Bibi said once more, and Fleurette thought that his voice had never sounded so harsh before.</p>
			<p>“But Bibi,” Fleurette said simply, “I often come to see Madame and Mademoiselle. And after you left this afternoon I felt so lonely and sad, I thought I might seek Mademoiselle Rose for company.”</p>
			<p>“And have you seen her?”</p>
			<p>“No. They told me Madame and Mademoiselle had gone.”</p>
			<p>“Who told you?”</p>
			<p>“Papa Mathieu.”</p>
			<p>“What else did he tell you?”</p>
			<p>“Only that there were soldiers come to the château; and that I’d better go home again⁠—and so I’m going.”</p>
			<p>“He didn’t tell you anything else?”</p>
			<p>“No,” Fleurette replied innocently. “Was there anything else to say?”</p>
			<p>“No⁠—er⁠—no,” Bibi rejoined. “Of course not. But Fleurette⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Bibi darling?”</p>
			<p>“How often must I tell you that you must not talk of ‘Madame’ and ‘Mademoiselle’? There are no Madames and Mademoiselles now; we are, all of us equally, citizens of France.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Bibi,” Fleurette rejoined demurely. “And I really, really am very careful when strangers are about. It doesn’t matter what I say before you, does it, <span xml:lang="fr">chéri</span> Bibi?”</p>
			<p>“No, no,” Bibi muttered, seemingly without much conviction, and Fleurette then went on quickly:</p>
			<p>“I must run home now, <span xml:lang="fr">chéri</span> Bibi, or Louise will be getting anxious. You are coming too, aren’t you? Louise will get you such a lovely supper and then⁠—”</p>
			<p>“No, my little one.” Bibi said. “I can’t. Not tonight. I must be in Orange tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>“But Bibi⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Run along, child,” Bibi broke in almost fiercely. “It’s a dark night, and there are always vagabonds about.”</p>
			<p>“Ah well then, good night, Bibi,” Fleurette murmured meekly.</p>
			<p>“Good night, little one.”</p>
			<p>And suddenly Bibi put out his hand and grasped Fleurette by the wrist.</p>
			<p>“Are you not going to kiss me, Fleurette?” he asked with oh! such a tone of sadness now in his voice.</p>
			<p>It was a terrible moment. What a mercy that the darling had seized her left wrist, rather than her right, because with her right hand Fleurette was hugging the small casket under her shawl. There were also the wallet and the moneybag in the pocket of her kirtle: oh! if Bibi should knock against them! Fortunately it was dark, and he could not see the bulge under her shawl. But, of course, she could not part from Bibi <span xml:lang="fr">chéri</span> without giving him a farewell kiss. He seemed sad and unhappy, and there was something about his whole manner that Fleurette did not understand.</p>
			<p>At first, when he startled her by suddenly appearing at the stable door, she had not even tried to conjecture what he was doing here; she was too deeply absorbed in her own adventure for the moment to do more than vaguely wonder what part Bibi was playing in the tragic events that had wrought such desolation at the château. Bibi <span xml:lang="fr">chéri</span>, who worshipped his little Fleurette, who was always so kind, so gentle, a slave to every one of her whims; he must have been dragged into this horrible affair, was perhaps an innocent tool of those cruel people in Paris, who monopolized his time and kept him away from his home.</p>
			<p>Indeed she had no mistrust in him whatever; but her trust in him did not go the length of telling him about the casket, or the mysterious voice of the faggot-carrier; those were her own secrets, secrets too which concerned the Frontenacs for whom Bibi had never evinced a very great affection, and had even tried to dissuade Fleurette from having too much intercourse with them. It was in fact her love for Madame and Monsieur, and for Mademoiselle Rose, and Bibi’s strange dislike of them, which had brought the only clouds in the sunshine of their affection.</p>
			<p>But of this Fleurette was not thinking at the moment, her one thought was of her secret and how best to guard it. All the same she would not have denied Bibi <span xml:lang="fr">chéri</span> the kiss he asked for. She must take the risk, that was all, and once again trust to her wits. She allowed him to put his arms round her neck and held up her fresh young face for his kiss: she held the casket so carefully that he did not feel its sharp angles. All was well, for now she was free from his embrace, but still he had hold of her left hand, and drew her close to him.</p>
			<p>“Fleurette, my little one,” he said earnestly.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Bibi.”</p>
			<p>“Do you know where the two Frontenac women have gone to?”</p>
			<p>“No, Bibi, I do not,” Fleurette was able to reply in all truthfulness, and looked her father straight in the eyes? “They were gone before I came.”</p>
			<p>“It is for their good that I ask you.”</p>
			<p>“I am sure it is, Bibi <span xml:lang="fr">chéri</span>, but really, really I do not know.”</p>
			<p>Bibi gave a quick, impatient sigh.</p>
			<p>“Ah, well! goodbye my Fleurette.”</p>
			<p>“Good night, Bibi.”</p>
			<p>At last she was free. With her left hand she blew a last kiss to Bibi, and then quickly sped across the yard. Her heart felt heavy, and there was an uncomfortable lump in her throat. For the first time she had been brought face to face with the realities of life. Hitherto she had lived in a kind of fairyland in which she was the carefully tended and guarded queen, and Bibi the acknowledged king as well as slave. Everything in the world was perfect, and lovely and wonderful; the men and women in it⁠—not only Bibi, but Louise, and <abbr>M.</abbr> Duflos the butcher and <abbr>M.</abbr> Colombe the grocer, and⁠—and <abbr>M.</abbr> Amédé⁠—they were all kind and generous and gentle. But now cruelty and spite had come within her ken. An ugly ghoul called “hatred” had passed by hand in hand with his ugly brother “mistrust” and the latter had whispered something in her ear just now, which had caused her to shrink within herself when Bibi had kissed her, and to turn from him and to run away with a strange sense of relief.</p>
			<p>She did not look back as she sped across the yard, and when she came to the small postern gate she was thankful to find it on the latch, so that she could slip out unseen.</p>
